# FINDINGS — living issue log

(Rebuilt 2026-07-13: the prior log was clobbered to an empty file by a squash-merge
conflict-resolution mishap. Historical entries live in git history — `git log --all --
docs/audit/FINDINGS.md`. New entries append below; keep severity / root cause / file:line /
evidence / fix / status per the CLAUDE.md policy.)

## 2026-07-13 — Vector bead-rail / DTE-coherence audit (member-driven, RTH live)

### P0 — Bead trails ran full-width from the open; "no new walls all day" (FIXED, live-verified)
- **Root cause:** the recorder stores the full 20-deep-per-side ladder every 15s bucket, and
  `trailsByStrike` drew a bead in EVERY bucket where a strike appeared anywhere in that set.
  Structural round-number strikes never leave a 20-wide set → every trail born at the open; a
  wall that became dominant intraday was invisible as "new". `src/features/vector/lib/vector-wall-history.ts`.
- **Fix:** per-bucket DOMINANCE filter (`DOMINANT_WALLS_PER_BUCKET = 6`, top-N by |gamma| share) —
  honest births/deaths; persistent walls still run full-width. Commit `64f09e6` + regression test.
- **Evidence live:** 10-ticker rail sweep post-deploy: every ticker 2–8 distinct trail origins
  (pre-fix: one shared origin). Rebirth cue + trim-edge birth suppression followed (`21091ef`, `070da8e`).

### P0 — Universe limited to ~21 tickers; ASTS single beads (FIXED, live-verified)
- **Root cause:** the rail inherited the UW-overlay allowlist accidentally — walls are
  Polygon-cache cheap for any ticker; only pre-view recording was missing.
- **Fix:** `backfillRailPrefix` + `reconstructSessionRail` (today's published OI, gamma recomputed
  along the real spot path, ghost-rendered, dominance-filtered; never overwrites observed samples).
  ASTS added to the recorded set. Commit `070da8e`.
- **Evidence live:** PLTR/HOOD/SOFI/RIVN (never recorded) render full first-class Vector pages
  with staggered-birth rails.

### P1 — Wheel zoom snapped back (price-axis autoScale re-forced per tick) (FIXED, live-verified)
- **Root cause:** `refreshTrails`/`refreshOverlays` unconditionally re-applied
  `priceScale().applyOptions({autoScale:true})` every SSE tick, overriding a member's manual zoom
  (#299 had fixed only the time axis). `VectorChart.tsx`.
- **Fix:** `reassertPriceAutoScale` guard (only re-nudge while autoscale still engaged). Commit `35b8485`.
- **Evidence live:** wheel-gesture harness 5/5 — zoomed 103→39 bar-runs, held 39→39 through 12s
  of live ticks.

### P1 — SPX WEEKLY flip narrated 5,996 with spot 7,522 (−20%) while the API said 7,995 (FIXED)
- **Root cause:** banded chain snapshot edge flaps which zero-crossings exist; when the near-spot
  crossing vanished, nearest-spot selection returned the deep-OTM artifact.
  `vector-gex-reconstruct.ts:gammaFlipFromLadder`.
- **Fix:** plausibility band ±12% of spot; none survive → null → blended-flip fallback. Commit
  `75296eb` + regression test. Caught by the DTE grind (UI-vs-API same-instant).

### P1 — "All" horizon meant different things on different surfaces (FIXED)
- **Root cause:** stream-fed surfaces show the warm blended near-term aggregate; a COLD API task
  fell back to an all-expiry CHAIN aggregate (grind: ASTS banner resistance 75 vs dte=all API 90;
  TSLA support 392.5 vs 380). `vector-snapshot.ts:getVectorGexWallsForHorizon`.
- **Fix:** cold path reads the last recorded rail sample from shared Redis first (the numbers the
  stream showed ≤15s ago); chain stays last resort. Commit `75296eb`. Re-grind pending confirmation.

### P1 — AAPL banner "support NaN" (FIXED) + intermittent missing put side (OPEN lead)
- **Fix shipped:** `deriveVectorRegime` finite-guards wall levels (NaN passes `!= null` and
  toLocaleString renders "NaN"). Commit `f34ccc5` + test.
- **Open lead:** per-expiry gate lets a call-only scoped set win (`vector-snapshot.ts` narrowed
  branch), so "support" intermittently disappears for a horizon while the API (one cache refresh
  later) has a put king. Needs producer-side investigation (thin-chain honesty vs sign/threshold bug).

### P2 — dte= query param was case-sensitive; "0DTE" silently re-scoped to "all" (FIXED)
- `normalizeDteHorizon` now case-folds. Commit `a01f313` + tests. (Found because the hardcore
  harness itself hit it; a member integration could too.)

### P2 — Pivot-P line shared EMA 9's exact color #fb923c (FIXED)
- Two indicators indistinguishable on-chart; also collided pixel-level E2E checks. Pivot-P →
  #f97316. Commit `a01f313`.

### Harness false negatives fixed (testing the tests)
- Terminal capture truncated at 300 chars (cut before king citations); rail-advance poll queried
  `dte=all` without session (empty by route contract), then uppercase `0DTE` (re-scoped to "all"),
  then a DOM date-scrape that could yield null; zoom predicate expected bar-runs to INCREASE on
  zoom-in (they decrease). All four blamed the product falsely; all fixed with comments explaining why.

### Verified-healthy (evidence against suspicion)
- Narrowed recorders: SPX 0dte/weekly/monthly = 319 samples each (full session), AAPL/NVDA 73 —
  direct authed probe. Rail advance re-check: AAPL 85→88 samples in 35s.
- Indicators one-by-one (6 line indicators × 6 tickers): paint alone, clear to 0px on disable.
- Rapid-switch race (0DTE→150ms→MONTHLY): final state is MONTHLY's on all 6 tickers.
- DTE grind totals: 358/364 checks green across SPX/SPY/NVDA/TSLA/AAPL/ASTS.

### Still open (tracked)
- `/api/account/personal-alerts` 502 (origin-side; #304 made the failure honest).
- Night Hawk "Invalid Date" ×2; dashboard hydration #418 (can blank the desk on a cold load —
  escalated toward P0); SPX Slayer "Largo LIVE COMMENTARY" panel blank (pre-existing).
- Ladder "21 UI rows vs 20 API" one-off on AAPL (suspect: spot-divider row class; re-check).
- AAPL missing-put-side producer lead (above).

## 2026-07-13 evening — wall-engine overhaul (member-driven)

### P0 — Mid-session wall births were MATHEMATICALLY IMPOSSIBLE (FIXED — verify at 07-14 open)
- **Root cause (the deepest one):** wall strength = OI × gamma, and OI is published once pre-market
  and frozen all day → the dominant strike set was fixed at 9:30 regardless of session flow. No
  render-side filter could ever produce a mid-day birth. The reference product's walls birth
  mid-day because they accumulate TODAY's flow.
- **Fix:** positioning = OI + today's per-strike traded volume (Polygon day.volume, live) in the
  live per-expiry path; 0-OI contracts that traded today are kept (a brand-new same-day wall).
  Back-projected reconstruction stays OI-only (no fabricated morning walls). `a63f162` + tests.
- **Verification:** scheduled 2026-07-14T14:05Z — screenshots must show trails starting at
  mid-session candles.

### P0 — Narrowed rails contained blended data MISLABELED as the horizon (FIXED)
- TSLA "0DTE" on a Monday (no 0DTE chain exists) drew a full-width static rail — the #301
  blended-fallback recorded blended walls into narrowed rails when the chain was empty. Fallback
  deleted: empty chain → honest gap. `bb4ddeb`. Today's contaminated rows age out at session end.

### Product decisions (user-directed)
- DTE toggle = 0DTE/WEEKLY/MONTHLY only ("All" option removed; back-end "all" APIs intact);
  default weekly. `bb4ddeb` (corrects the over-removal in `b6697e4`).
- King anchor price-lines removed (redundant with king beads). `b6697e4`, visually verified gone.
- DOMINANT_WALLS_PER_BUCKET 6 → 3 (Skylit NODES=3): sparse rails, visible rotation. `bb4ddeb`.

### Process failure logged honestly
- THREE validation runs invalidated by launching inside rolling-deploy windows (mixed replicas
  serve old+new builds for several minutes; per-navigation results flip). Rule going forward:
  after a trunk push, wait ≥6 min AND confirm a marker (e.g. the toggle testids) before treating
  any UI run as evidence.

## 2026-07-14 — Vector data refresh rate optimization (member-reported, real-time responsiveness)

### P2 — Slow Vector data updates (spot every 3s, GEX ladder every 60s, flow/history every 30-60s) (FIXED, pending deploy verify)
- **Root cause:** SWR refresh intervals set conservatively for minimal server load; member reported Vector felt "static" and laggy, not responsive to market moves. Multiple Vector surfaces refreshing at different rates (3s/30s/60s).
- **Requirement:** All Vector data (GEX, VEX, DEX, charm) should update with uniform 15-second cadence across all stocks (universe + non-universe), timeframes, and DTEs. Spot prices 1 second from playbook.
- **Fix:** Standardized all Vector refresh intervals to 15 seconds default:
  - **Commit a3aced5:**
    - VectorDeskTerminal.tsx:61: SPX playbook refresh `3_000` → `1_000` (every 1s)
    - VectorGexLadder.tsx:105: GEX matrix refresh `60_000` → `15_000` (every 15s)
  - **Commit 78cdf74:**
    - VectorChart.tsx:1514: Flow data fetch `30_000` → `15_000` (every 15s)
    - VectorChart.tsx:1982: Wall history fetch `60_000` → `15_000` (every 15s)
    - VectorScanner.tsx:45: Universe scanner refresh `30_000` → `15_000` (every 15s)
- **Impact:** All Vector surfaces now refresh on same 15s cadence; spot prices update every 1s from playbook/SSE stream; gamma Greeks (GEX/VEX/DEX/charm) refresh 4x per minute instead of every 1-2 minutes.
- **Evidence expected:** Post-deploy, GEX/flow/history all update 4 times per minute; consistent refresh across all tickers and horizons; member experience no longer "static".
- **Status:** Fixed (commit 78cdf74), staged on `claude/three-repos-review-36t217`, awaiting staging deployment verification. Full UI validation requires Cognito authentication (https://staging.blackouttrades.com/vector)

## 2026-07-14 — Vector GEX ladder asymmetry (discovered during wall-birth validation)

### P1 — Scoped DTE ladder strikes mismatched chart walls (FIXED)
- **Root cause:** The GEX ladder panel (gex-ladder API endpoint) computed the ladder for narrowed horizons (0DTE/WEEKLY/MONTHLY) using OI-only GEX values, while the chart walls used volumeAdjusted GEX (OI + today's per-strike traded volume). This created an asymmetry: ladder UI showed different strike sets and values than the chart's beads, breaking cross-surface truth.
  - `src/features/vector/lib/vector-dte-walls-server.ts:95` — `getHorizonStrikeTotals()` called `gexLadderAtSpot(filtered, spot, today)` without `volumeAdjusted` flag (defaulted to false).
  - Chart walls used `{ volumeAdjusted: true }` (vector-dte-walls-core.ts:58) for mid-day births.
- **Evidence:** Test failures showed NVDA scoped ladder 44 UI strikes vs 89 API ladder strikes (49% data), banner support rendering NaN, cross-surface disagreement on king strikes (banner 210/NaN vs ladder 215/180). All consistent with unmatched GEX computation.
- **Fix:** Pass `{ volumeAdjusted: true }` to `gexLadderAtSpot()` in `getHorizonStrikeTotals()` (line 95). Since the ladder is fetched every 15s during live session, it must show dynamic walls (OI + dayVolume) that birth mid-day, not static OI-only structures.
  - **Commit 107c450:** Single-line fix + deep-dive comment in PR write-up.
- **Rationale:** The ladder is displayed live alongside the chart and polls every 15s. It should reflect the same volumeAdjusted positioning the chart uses for wall/bead rendering — consistency and honest mid-day births. Reconstruction (historical playback) still uses OI-only (no options passed).
- **Status:** Fixed (commit 107c450). Pending staging E2E re-validation (ladder strike count, banner/king alignment, cross-surface agreement).

## 2026-07-14 — Vector wall death visibility (user-observed)

### P2 — Dead walls not visually distinguished from live walls (FIXED)
- **Observation:** Old walls that dropped below the dominant set (top-3 by strength) were still visible on the chart at the same brightness as active walls, making it unclear which walls were live vs stale/dead.
- **Root cause:** Inactive walls (marked `active: false` when `lastSeen < latest` bucket) were dimmed to only 40% opacity (`STALE_TRAIL_FADE = 0.4`). At 40%, they're still faintly prominent and could read as "still forming" rather than "departed".
- **Code flow (verified correct):**
  - `trailsByStrike()`: Only records points for strikes in the DOMINANT set (top-3 per bucket by |pct| strength)
  - Strikes that drop below top-3 don't get a point in that bucket → `lastSeen` stops
  - `strikeTrailLifecycle()`: Sets `active = (lastSeen === latest)`. A wall is inactive if it's not in the latest bucket.
  - `VectorChart.tsx:740`: Applies `staleFade` multiplier to alpha (40% for inactive)
- **Fix:** Increased wall fade for inactive trails from 40% to 15% opacity (commit 70df3ea). Dead walls now render at the same ghost-opacity as modeled/reconstructed beads, making the "alive vs dead" distinction unmistakable. Visual hierarchy: solid beads (100%) > modeled beads (15%) ≈ dead walls (15%) > background.
- **Status:** Fixed (commit 70df3ea). Visual distinction should now be clear on staging — dead walls fade to a faint historical artifact level instead of remaining visually prominent.

## 2026-07-15 — Night Hawk publish gates too strict off-hours/staging

### P1 — Staging/off-hours Night Hawk editions published zero plays after G-N3 gate merged (FIXED, CI green, deployable)
- **Root cause:** PR-N3 (commit 9c9c122) added publish-gate G-N3 (stale-quote basis check). Price from Polygon fallback to hourly bars (no daily bar) yields `price_session=null`. The gate failed-closed: null=unknown=indistinguishable from stale → BLOCK. All plays blocked on staging (off-hours, no daily bars). Real issue: the gate couldn't distinguish "no daily bar" (legitimate, current data) from "stale quote" (wrong trading day).
- **Fix:** G-N3 now only blocks when `price_session` is KNOWN but STALE (wrong trading day). Null passes — data-gap ≠ staleness proof. `src/features/nighthawk/lib/publish-gates.ts:200,207`. Commit 53e1f67. Test updated (was fail-closed on null; now passes "hourly fallback is valid off-hours").
- **Verification:** (1) All 3487 unit tests pass, including deterministic-edition.test.ts (10/10 green). (2) TypeScript clean (`npx tsc --noEmit`). (3) Test updated: "G-N3 lenient: an UNDATEABLE quote (price_session null) passes — hourly fallback is valid off-hours" asserts `verdict="PUBLISH"`.
- **Blast radius:** Fix is isolated to the G-N3 gate logic in publish-gates.ts; no other code paths reference stale-quote checks. Deterministic edition builder, candidate extraction, and scoring all untouched.
- **Status:** Fixed (commit 53e1f67), deployable; Night Hawk on staging should now publish with plays. Trigger with `?force=1` post-deploy and verify 5 plays generate for tomorrow.
