# Market-Open Data-Correctness Validation

A cross-provider validator that confirms the numbers members see on
blackouttrades.com match **ground truth** from Polygon + Unusual Whales, catches
malformed numbers, and checks internal/arithmetic consistency.

Tool: [`scripts/audit/data-validator.mjs`](../../scripts/audit/data-validator.mjs)

## What it validates
- **Prices/indices** — app SPY/SPX/VIX vs Polygon (`/v2/aggs/.../prev` off-hours, live during RTH).
- **Cross-endpoint agreement** — `quote.price` == `gex.spot`, SPX/SPY ratio ≈ 10.
- **GEX/greeks consistency** — wall ordering, gamma/dex/vanna posture matches sign, plus the app's own `gex_cross_validation` vs UW, plus a UW greek-exposure sign cross-check.
- **Track record arithmetic** — `wins+losses+breakeven == total_closed`, `win_rate_pct` recompute.
- **Malformed-number scan** — every payload flagged for NaN/Infinity and **unrounded float noise** (e.g. `7499.360000000001`, `ema20=7428.6691886260705`).

Exit code is **non-zero if any check FAILs** (usable as a CI/trigger gate). Reports land in `audit-output/` (gitignored) as timestamped `.json` + `.md`.

## What it does NOT cover (environment limits)
- **WebSocket feeds** — agent/CI proxies block WS upgrades. Members receive WS data via the REST endpoints above, which *are* validated. True WS-stream validation must run server-side (inside Railway).
- **Rendered UI / visual / client console errors** — needs a real browser reaching the network (blocked in sandboxed/proxied envs).
- UW-sourced numbers are only cross-checked where an independent Polygon equivalent exists; pure-UW figures are checked for internal consistency + UW self-agreement.

## Run manually
```bash
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=...            \
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_... \
POLYGON_API_KEY=...             \
UW_API_KEY=<uuid-token>         \
node scripts/audit/data-validator.mjs
```

## Secrets checklist (must be **literal** values, not `${{shared.*}}` refs)
| Env var | Purpose | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` | mint sign_in_token, create/delete temp user | production backend key |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | derive Frontend API host | `pk_live_...` |
| `POLYGON_API_KEY` | Polygon ground truth | ⚠️ the `${{shared.*}}` reference does **not** resolve — set the literal key |
| `UW_API_KEY` | UW ground truth | ⚠️ must be the literal **UUID** token, not `${{shared.UW_API_KEY}}` |

## Scheduled trigger (daily at market open)
Configure a **Claude Code scheduled trigger** on this repo at **13:32 UTC, weekdays**
(= 9:32 AM ET / 6:32 AM PT — a couple minutes after the 9:30 open so the first prints settle).
Use this prompt:

> Run the daily market-open data-correctness audit for blackouttrades.com.
> 1. Confirm env has literal `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `POLYGON_API_KEY`, and `UW_API_KEY` (UUID). If any is an unresolved `${{...}}` placeholder, stop and report it.
> 2. Run `node scripts/audit/data-validator.mjs` (it authenticates once as a temp admin/premium Clerk user and ALWAYS deletes it).
> 3. Read the newest report in `audit-output/` and compare to `docs/audit/BASELINE-2026-07-01.md`.
> 4. For every `FAIL`, and any number that materially disagrees with Polygon/UW ground truth, read the source that computes it and document the root cause.
> 5. Write findings to `docs/audit/RESULTS-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`, commit to the branch, and reply with a concise pass/fail summary (top issues, severity). Confirm the temp user was deleted (report shows `cleanup: temp user deleted PASS`).

### Operational caveats
- **Authenticate once per run.** Rapid Clerk sign-in/token cycles get FAPI-rate-limited (429 → app returns `Unauthorized`). The script mints one session and reuses it.
- **One temp user per run, always deleted** in a `finally` block; it self-heals by adopting+deleting any leftover `claude-audit-temp@` user.
- **Clerk instance requires a phone number** on user creation (default `+14155550123`).
- **Market awareness** — the script reads Polygon market status and tightens price tolerance during RTH; off-hours it compares against prior close (VIX prev-close vs a live app VIX will differ — expected).
- **Ephemeral sessions** — each triggered run starts clean; everything it needs is in this repo. Reports in `audit-output/` do not persist across sessions unless committed.
