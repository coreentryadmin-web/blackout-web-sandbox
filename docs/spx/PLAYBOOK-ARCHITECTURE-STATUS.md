# SPX Playbook — Architecture & Status (Single Source of Truth)

**Repo:** `coreentryadmin-web/blackout-web-sandbox` → `https://staging.blackouttrades.com`  
**Last updated:** 2026-07-10  
**Scope:** Staging playbook lab only — do **not** merge to Railway prod `blackout-web` `main` unless explicitly requested.

This document consolidates architecture, implementation status, per-playbook fidelity, four setup families, what is fixed, what remains, validation tiers, and code map. Older docs (`PLAYBOOK-ARCHITECTURE-DEEP-DIVE.md`, `PLAYBOOK-IMPLEMENTATION-ROADMAP.md`, etc.) remain as detail appendices; **start here** for current truth.

## 1. Executive summary

| Dimension | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| **Model** | Playbook-first BUY on staging (14 named setups PB-01…PB-14) replacing opaque confluence score |
| **Staging deploy** | Playbook lab **hardwired** via `isStagingDeploy()` — live gate always on |
| **Live allowlist** | PB-01, PB-02, PB-03, PB-04 only (`PLAYBOOK_LIVE_ALLOWLIST`) |
| **Prod Railway** | Legacy confluence BUY unless `PLAYBOOK_LIVE_GATE=1` (off) |
| **Primary selection** | FULL-SPEC §5 order minus PB-09 (HELIX modifier only) |
| **State machine** | Per-instance transitions with **invalidation**; still tick-recomputed matchers |
| **Evidence** | n=19 prod outcomes mined; autonomous prod BUY frozen until tier thresholds |

**Bottom line:** Staging is the evidence lab. Architecture is promising; **trading edge remains unproven**. Do not confuse explainability with profitability. Four families validate edge before per-PB label splits. PB-09 demoted. Unknown regime and severe data quality fail-closed on live BUY. MVP matchers stay shadow-only until promotion tiers met.

> **Critical takeaway:** Do not interpret the sophistication of the architecture as evidence that the strategy works. The architecture enables falsifiable hypotheses; profitability requires clean prospective evidence, execution realism, and risk controls.

### Layer responsibilities

| Layer | Owns | Does not own |
|-------|------|--------------|
| **Matcher** | Preconditions (ARM), triggers (FIRE), direction, session window, regime eligibility | Position sizing, exits |
| **Gates** | Session/risk vetoes, macro windows, halt, grade floors, **A17 playbook live gate** | Direction pick |
| **Engine** | BUY/SCANNING/WATCHING, confluence score (legacy), open play lifecycle | Per-PB invalidation after entry |
| **Management** | STOP/TARGET/TRIM/THESIS/THETA | Named setup identity on exit |

### Gate categories (post-hoc labels today)

`blocks_by_category` on `PlayGateResult`: `operational`, `risk`, `validity`, `quality`. Evaluation is still flat AND — **split evaluation order is phase 2**.

### Data quality modes (live gate)

| Mode | Condition | Live BUY effect |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| `normal` | All feeds fresh | Standard per-PB rules |
| `degraded` | 1 issue (halt stale **or** desk stale **or** gex missing) | Event/breakout PBs blocked (PB-03,05,09,13,14) |
| `severe` | 2+ issues simultaneously | **Fail-closed** all live playbook BUY |

Global halt channel remains **fail-open** with warning in `spx-play-gates.ts` (confirmed live halt still blocks).

---

## 3. Four setup families

Validate **family edge first**, then test whether individual PB labels separate outcomes.

| Family | Playbooks | Role | Live allowlist today |
|--------|-----------|------|----------------------|
| **Trend continuation** | PB-03, PB-05, PB-06, PB-08, PB-10 | Breakouts, wall rides, power hour, EMA stack | PB-03 |
| **Mean reversion** | PB-02, PB-04, PB-07, PB-11 | VWAP reject, pin fade, max pain, chop scalp | PB-02, PB-04 |
| **Reversal / failure** | PB-01, PB-12, PB-13, PB-14 | VWAP reclaim, lotto reversal, gap fade, failed ORB | PB-01 |
| **Flow / event (modifier)** | PB-09 | HELIX surge — **never primary** | None |

Registry fields: `setup_family`, `fidelity` (`high` | `mvp`) on each `PlaybookDefinition` in `playbook-registry.ts`.

### Primary priority (FULL-SPEC §5 minus PB-09)

```
PB-13 → PB-14 → PB-03 → PB-05 → PB-06 → PB-04 → PB-07 → PB-08 → PB-01 → PB-02 → PB-10 → PB-11 → PB-12
(PB-09 never primary — flow modifier only)
```

Implemented in `playbook-primary-rank.ts` → `pickPrimaryPlaybook()`. Family fields drive `family_audit` telemetry rollup.

---

## 4. What changed from the old model

| Old (confluence) | New (playbook) |
|------------------|----------------|
| Scalar score + grade | Named setup with ARM/TRIGGER/INVALIDATION |
| Direction = sign(score) → long-only bias | Per-PB direction + short pipeline audit |
| "Factor soup" — no audit trail | `playbook_id` on open + shadow telemetry |
| Bought breakouts inside gamma pin | Regime router + family-aware primary |
| HELIX could dominate primary | PB-09 demoted to modifier |

**Evidence (prod n=19):** 31.6% win rate, grade did not predict, 18/19 entries in `mean_revert` γ at entry. See `PLAYBOOK-EVIDENCE-BASE.md`.

---

## 5. Runtime flow (today)

Every ~2s play poll on staging:

1. `buildPlayTechnicals(desk)` — OR, VWAP streaks, EMA9 curl, breakout flags
2. `matchPlaybooksShadow(desk, technicals, now, { or_break_memory })` — 14 verdicts
3. `pickPrimaryPlaybook(verdicts)` — excludes PB-09; family-grouped tie-break
4. `evaluatePlayGates(..., { playbook_primary_id, playbook_primary_direction })` — A17 on BUY
5. `buildPlaybookShadowPanel()` → API `playbook_shadow` with `pipeline_audit` + `family_audit`
6. `maybeLogPlaybookShadowMatch()` → Postgres + instance transitions
7. If gates pass + lab path → `openPlay()` with `playbook_id`, `execution_sim` on option ticket

### State machine (stub → P1)

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `idle` | Window closed, regime ineligible, or no precondition |
| `armed` | `precondition_match` true |
| `triggered` | `trigger_fired` true |
| `invalidated` | Lost precondition after armed, or trigger dropped after fired |

`collectPlaybookInstanceTransitions()` uses `resolvePlaybookLifecycleState()` — persisted to `spx_playbook_instances` / shadow row `instance_transitions`.

**Still tick-recomputed:** matchers do not require prior armed duration or blocked-while-armed ordering (phase 2).

## 6. Per-playbook status matrix

| ID | Name | Family | Fidelity | Matcher | Live | Notes |

## 9. Gates, flags, and live allowlist

### Staging (always on)

- `playbookStagingLabEnabled()` → `isStagingDeploy()` at Docker build
- `playbookLiveGateEnabled()` → true on staging
- Default allowlist: `PB-01,PB-02,PB-03,PB-04` (`PLAYBOOK_LIVE_ALLOWLIST_DEFAULT_STAGING`)
- Infra: `blackout-infra` `apply-staging-env-overrides.mjs` sets `PLAYBOOK_LIVE_ALLOWLIST`

### Gate A17 checklist (live BUY)

1. `playbook_primary_id` not null (fired primary, PB-09 excluded)
2. Primary in `PLAYBOOK_LIVE_ALLOWLIST`
3. Not `isUnknownPlaybookRegime(desk)`
4. Not `severe` data quality mode
5. Not `isDegradedForLivePlaybook(pbId, flags)` for event PBs
6. Direction aligns with staging lab path when applicable

### Prod

- Playbook live gate **off** unless `PLAYBOOK_LIVE_GATE=1`
- No autonomous BUY expansion without evidence sign-off

---

## 10. Telemetry & evidence promotion

### Tables

| Table | Content |
|-------|---------|
| `spx_playbook_shadow_observations` | Verdicts, `pipeline_audit`, `family_audit`, `feature_snapshot`, `instance_transitions` |
| `spx_playbook_instances` | Durable per-day per-PB state |
| `spx_open_play.playbook_id` | PB on entry |
| `spx_play_outcomes.playbook_id` | PB on close for joins |

### Promotion tiers (unchanged)

| Tier | Threshold |
|------|-----------|
| Research | ≥30 triggers, ≥20 simulated trades |
| Staging-qualified | 50–75 prospective, cost-adjusted expectancy |
| Limited-live prod | Min size + risk governor + per-trade quote reconciliation |

**Do not** enable prod autonomous BUY or expand allowlist without meeting tiers.

## 11. External assessment scores

Independent review (2026-07-10) — aligned with repo policy:

| Dimension | Score | Assessment |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| **Architecture** | 8/10 | Layered model, shadow rollout, named setups, state-machine direction, telemetry path are strong |
| **Strategy specification** | 6/10 | Thoughtful rules, but static thresholds, weak proxies, incomplete fields, overlapping playbooks |
| **Evidence quality** | 2/10 | n=19 prod trades, all long, negative avg P&L, no playbook-specific prospective sample |
| **Production readiness** | 3/10 | Appropriate for shadow/staging; not trusted autonomous 0DTE generation |
| **Potential** | 8/10 | Could become serious if next work is prospective evidence + execution realism + risk controls |

### ChatGPT addendum scorecard (post #67)

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Engineering** | 8.5/10 | Signal engine → structural framework; telemetry + shadow path strong |
| **Research framework** | 9/10 | Instance events, OOS firewall, evidence report, blocked-setup logging |
| **Strategy maturity** | 5/10 | Rules exist; static thresholds, MVP matchers, edge unproven |
| **Production readiness** | 4/10 | Shadow/staging appropriate; not autonomous prod |

> Treat as a **research platform** until robust prospective evidence demonstrates durable expectancy.

## 12. ChatGPT Findings Addendum

**Source:** ChatGPT review of `PLAYBOOK-ARCHITECTURE-STATUS.md` (2026-07-10).  
**Verdict:** Architecture improved significantly — engineering direction is strong; **trading edge is not statistically proven**.

### Major improvements (agreed + shipped)

| Finding | Repo status |
|---------|-------------|
| Four playbook families reduce complexity | ✅ `setup_family` on registry + `family_audit` |
| PB-09 (HELIX) demoted — confirmation/modifier, not primary | ✅ `playbook-primary-rank.ts` |
| Unknown regime fail-closed on live BUY | ✅ Gate A17 |
| Immutable telemetry + shadow deployment | ✅ `spx_playbook_instance_events` + append-only snapshots |
| Staging limited to PB-01–PB-04 | ✅ `PLAYBOOK_LIVE_ALLOWLIST` |

### Remaining concerns (honest)

| Priority | Item | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| **P0** | Full persistent state machine (not tick-recomputed) | 🟡 Armed-poll guard + `armed_poll_count`; not full blocked-while-armed |
| **P0** | Option-level execution modelling | 🟡 Entry + exit sim + `round_trip_cost_pts` at open |
| **P1** | Playbook-specific exits | ✅ `playbookExitProfile` in `evaluateOpenPlay` |
| **P1** | Volatility-aware thresholds (not static pts) | ✅ VIX/OR scaled buffers in matchers |
| **P1** | Session-level risk governor expansion | ✅ Per-PB trigger cap + degraded size multiplier |

### Research methodology (agreed policy)

1. Gather **larger prospective samples** (OOS from 2026-07-10+) — infrastructure ready, data accumulating  
2. **Separate hypothesis generation from validation** — n=19 = training only; `playbook:evidence-report` enforces OOS  
3. **Validate parameters out-of-sample** — `playbook:param-sweep` stability bands; no n=19 tuning  
4. Optimize for **expectancy**, not win rate — report script includes profit factor / expectancy  

### Production readiness statement

Appropriate for **shadow testing and staged validation** on `staging.blackouttrades.com`.  
**Not** ready for fully autonomous production trading until execution modelling, durable state semantics, and broader prospective evidence are complete.

**Staging deploy note:** `ecr-push-staging.yml` now triggers ECS `force-new-deployment` after each push to `:staging`. Manual roll only needed if the workflow is skipped.

```bash
aws ecs update-service --cluster blackout-staging-cluster \
  --service blackout-staging-web --force-new-deployment
```

### Recommended roadmap (ChatGPT order)

| Step | Item | Status |

## 13. Data & research requirements

ChatGPT research checklist (2026-07-10). **Implemented on staging** unless noted.

### 12.1 Capture every eligible setup — not only opens

| Capability | Status |

## 14. Instance schema

Target row per playbook instance (research contract):

| # | Field | Status | Where today |
|---|-------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | `session_date` | ✅ | `spx_playbook_instances` |
| 2 | `playbook_id` | ✅ | same |
| 3 | `instance_id` | ✅ | `{session}:{playbook_id}` |
| 4 | `armed_at` | ✅ | COALESCE on first armed |
| 5 | `triggered_at` | ✅ | COALESCE on first triggered |
| 6 | `invalidated_at` | ✅ | Set on invalidated transition |
| 7 | `opened_at` | ✅ | Patched on engine open |
| 8 | `closed_at` | 🟡 | Join `spx_play_outcomes` |
| 9 | `direction` | ✅ | instance row |
| 10 | regime snapshot | ✅ | `feature_snapshot` + events |
| 11 | input feature snapshot | ✅ | Full snapshot on each event |
| 12 | data-quality flags | ✅ | `data_quality_mode`, halt, desk, gex |
| 13 | reason armed | ✅ | event `reason` + `detail` |
| 14 | reason triggered | ✅ | event `reason` |
| 15 | reason blocked | ✅ | `reason_blocked` + blocked events |
| 16 | reason invalidated | ✅ | `reason_invalidated` |
| 17 | underlying entry reference | ✅ | `trigger_price` + `price_at_event` |
| 18 | option contract candidate | ✅ | `option_contract_candidate` on open |
| 19 | counterfactual MFE/MAE | ✅ | Instance row + blocked path |
| 20 | actual outcome | 🟡 | `spx_play_outcomes` join when opened |

**Coverage today: ~17/20 complete, ~2/20 partial (closed_at join, outcome when no open).**

---

## 15. Expectancy metrics

Per playbook (and per family), compute from **prospective OOS sample only**:

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| armed / triggered / executable counts | ✅ `playbook:evidence-report` |
| win rate, mean/median return | ✅ Report script (OOS SQL) |
| profit factor, expectancy | ✅ Report script |
| median MAE / MFE (closed) | ✅ Report script |
| median counterfactual MFE/MAE | ✅ Report script |
| MFE capture %, tail loss, downside deviation | ⏳ Needs more closed OOS trades |
| time in trade | 🟡 On outcomes table |
| results after cost assumptions | 🟡 `execution_sim` at open |
| performance by VIX / gamma regime | ⏳ Extend report SQL |

> A 40% win-rate system can be excellent. A 60% win-rate system can lose money.

```bash
npm run playbook:evidence-report
npm run playbook:param-sweep
```

---

## 16. Hard constants

Several thresholds are **documented but lightly motivated**. Do **not** optimize each independently on n=19. Use **stability bands** — a real edge should survive 8↔12 pts proximity, not disappear at small moves.

| Constant | Default | Env override | Validation band (proposed) |
|----------|---------|--------------|----------------------------|
| Wall proximity | 10 pts | `SPX_PLAY_STRUCTURE_PROX_PTS` | 8–12 |
| MTF breakout buffer | 1 pt | `SPX_PLAY_MTF_BUFFER_PTS` | 0.5–2 |
| Wall stop offset | 3 pts | code | 2–4 |
| HELIX stop | 5 pts | code | 4–6 |
| Gap threshold (PB-13) | 0.3% | matcher | 0.25–0.35% |
| Range chop (PB-11) | 0.35% | matcher | 0.30–0.40% |
| RSI stretch (PB-12) | 72/28 | matcher | 70–74 / 26–30 |
| VWAP duration (PB-01) | 15 min | matcher | 12–18 min |
| Flow materiality (PB-02) | 100k | `PLAYBOOK_FLOW_MATERIALITY_MIN` | 75k–150k |

Implemented in `playbook-evidence-config.ts` + `npm run playbook:param-sweep`. **Do not** optimize each constant on n=19; sweep validates configured values sit inside bands. Full replay sensitivity needs accumulated OOS instance events.

## 17. Code map

| Module | Role |
|--------|------|
| `playbook-registry.ts` | PB-01…14 + `setup_family` + `fidelity` |
