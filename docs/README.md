# BLACKOUT — Documentation (single source of truth)

**This `docs/` folder is the ONLY place BLACKOUT documentation lives.** Anything worth writing down
goes here — not scattered `.md` files at the repo root, not a second `audits/` pile, not inside a
`/docs/*` app route. If a doc isn't in here, it isn't canonical.

> **Policy going forward:** one folder, one source of truth. Don't create audit/plan/notes `.md`
> files elsewhere in the repo. Update the relevant file in here instead. Generated/data files that
> back app routes (e.g. `src/lib/api-provider-catalog.ts`) are **code**, not docs — they should be
> regenerated from `BLACKOUT_API_REFERENCE.md`, not hand-edited.

History: consolidated 2026-06-24. The June 2026 audit pile was removed from the tree in 2026-07
(see [`archive/README.md`](archive/README.md) — recover from git history if needed).

## Known follow-up (not yet done)
The internal **`/docs/*` app routes** (`cursor-api-analysis`, `claude-api-analysis`, `system-analysis`,
`spx-sniper/*-analysis`, `api-probe`, `polygon/*`, `unusual-whales/*`) and their backing data
(`cursor-api-analysis-data.ts`, `docs-probe-report.json`, `scripts/uw-docs-index.md`) are **stale
"analysis" pages** the audit flagged (IP-leak risk + ~7,500 LOC; `08-SECURITY.md`, priority R-24).
They are **code**, intertwined with the admin dashboard (`admin-endpoint-registry.ts` imports
`docs-probe-report.json`), so removing them is a careful refactor: decouple admin first, then delete
the routes/data. Tracked here so it isn't forgotten.
