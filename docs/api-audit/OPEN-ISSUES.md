> 04:08 ET run (Sunday, market closed): **1 NET-NEW P2** + both standing P1s re-confirmed open.
> **NEW P2 — options-socket shard 0 stuck in a code=1006 reconnect loop (`failures=531`).** Live
> `blackout-web` logs cycle every 60s: `connected (1 contracts)` → `reconnect in 60000ms
> (code=1006, failures=531)`. `consecutiveFailures` resets only on successful auth
> (`src/lib/ws/options-socket.ts:405-406`), so 531 = no sustained authed stream in ~8h. Closes are
> **server-initiated 1006**, not the stall watchdog (which already gates off-hours, `:453-457`).
> Benign now (market closed, `MAX_CONNECTIONS=1` slot just churning + log noise) BUT the unbounded
> counter masks a real RTH failure. **ACTION: re-check after 09:30 ET Mon** — if `failures` resets
> toward 0 once quotes flow it's cosmetic off-hours churn; if pinned, Night's Watch live valuations
> degrade → promote to P1. Suggested fix: gate `scheduleReconnect`/heartbeat on options-RTH like the
> stall watchdog already is. **P1-B STILL OPEN:** `/api/signals/open` → **200 unauthenticated**
> (`{"ok":true,"signals":[]}` now, empty/EOD-scored — but leaks paid SPX_SLAYER/NIGHT_HAWK signals
> during RTH); sibling POST routes correctly 405 on GET. Fix: add `isCronAuthorized` or delete
> (`signals/open/route.ts:8`). **P1-A STILL OPEN:** no `Market-Regime-Detector` service in
> `railway status` (`.toml` exists, never created → `market_regime`/`flow_anomalies` writers never
> run). Re-verified GREEN: site 200s + correct 401s on all tool/admin endpoints, tsc 0 (needs ≥4GB

> 00:14 run (2026-06-28, Saturday night, market closed): **1 NET-NEW P1 (P1-B)** —
> `/api/signals/open` serves **200 unauthenticated** and returns up to 500 `signal_events`
> rows incl. `grade`/`ticker`/`strike`/`expiry`/`option_type`/`entry_mark`/`confluence_score`
> — i.e. the paid SPX_SLAYER + NIGHT_HAWK signal output. Currently empty live
> (`{"ok":true,"signals":[]}`, market closed/all scored to EOD) but **leaks live signals to
> anyone during RTH**. Distinct from P2-A (those are market-wide/no-paid-data); this one IS
> paid data. No in-repo consumer fetches it and the `signal-outcome-tracker` cron its comment
> cites does not exist → orphaned. Fix: add `isCronAuthorized` (sibling write routes already
> have it) or delete. `signals/open/route.ts:8`. **P3-3 gets a 3rd instance:**
> `track-record/publish/route.ts:9` uses the same fail-open `if (CRON_SECRET && …)` guard.
> Re-verified GREEN: site 200s + correct 401s, tsc 0, db Pool error handler present, redis
> family:0 + retry, SPX veto+open logic both present, #97/#100/#101/#102 confirmed fixed,
> VAPID/GEX-alerts now fully armed (`NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY`+`VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY`+
> `VAPID_SUBJECT`+`GEX_ALERTS_PUSH` all set). Carried unchanged (not re-queryable this run —
> `railway status`/`logs` need `--service` with project token): P1-A, P2-C, P2-B.

> 20:15 run (Saturday, market closed): **P1-A REFINED — effort dropped from "build the writer" to
> "create one Railway service."** The regime/anomaly writer is now fully built in code
> (`cron/market-regime-detector/route.ts` + `cron-registry.ts:217` + `railway.market-regime-detector.toml`),

## 🔴 P0 — none open

## 🟠 P1 — open
- [ ] **P1-A** Regime + flow-anomaly features still dead in prod — but writer is BUILT, just unwired.
  **Refined 20:15:** the writer cron now EXISTS in code (`src/app/api/cron/market-regime-detector/route.ts`
  + registry `cron-registry.ts:217` + `railway.market-regime-detector.toml`, schedule `*/5 11-21 * * 1-5`).
  But prod ground truth confirms it has **never run**: `market_regime`=**0 rows**, `flow_anomalies`=**0 rows**,
  `cron_job_runs[market-regime-detector]`=**0 runs/7d**, and **no Market-Regime-Detector service in
  `railway status`** (23 services, not one of them). The `.toml` header says "Wire it up: create a cron
  service → Config-as-code" — that manual Railway step was never done, so nothing hits the route.
  **Live consumers still degrading:** (1) `FlowAnomalyBanner` on paid `/flows` (`src/app/(site)/flows/page.tsx:41`;
  fetch `FlowAnomalyBanner.tsx:59`) → never renders; (2) `nighthawk-morning-confirm` reads via
  `/api/platform/intel` (`cron/nighthawk-morning-confirm/route.ts:110`) → defaults `currentRegime="UNKNOWN"`/0
  anomalies (`platform/intel/route.ts:72,89`). Violates "values live/correct/grounded, never blank".
  **Fix is now a single deploy action (no code):** create the Railway cron service from
  `railway.market-regime-detector.toml` via Config-as-code, set `CRON_SECRET` on it, confirm first run
  writes `market_regime`. _(found 12:13; refined 20:15 — writer confirmed built, only Railway trigger missing)_
- [ ] **P1-B (NEW 2026-06-28 00:14)** Entitlement leak — `/api/signals/open` is unauthenticated.
  `src/app/api/signals/open/route.ts:8` `GET` runs an unguarded query returning up to 500
  `signal_events` rows with `grade`, `ticker`, `strike`, `expiry`, `option_type`, `entry_mark`,
  `confluence_score` — the paid SPX_SLAYER + NIGHT_HAWK signal output. **Verified live:
  `GET https://www.blackouttrades.com/api/signals/open` → HTTP 200** (empty now — market closed,
  all scored to EOD — but exposes the day's live signals to anyone during RTH). Distinct from
  P2-A (market-wide/no-paid-data); this is paid data. **Orphaned**: no in-repo consumer fetches
  it, and the `signal-outcome-tracker` cron its comment cites does not exist anywhere in `src/`.
  **Fix:** add `isCronAuthorized` (sibling write routes `signals/record`+`signals/outcome` already
  have it) or delete the route. _(found 2026-06-28 00:14)_

## 🟡 P2 — open
- [ ] **P2-C ⏳ WATCH** SPX play ledger empty all-time (`spx_open_play`=0, `spx_play_outcomes`=0, re-verified live in prod 16:10). **Refined 16:10:** the engine never reached a BUY — `cron_job_runs` for `spx-evaluate` over the last 3 active days = **198 SCANNING · 24 WATCHING · 0 BUY/APPROVE · 42 skipped**. Cause is the confluence/Claude gates not approving, NOT the option-chain veto (confirmed disabled: `SPX_OPTION_CHAIN_REQUIRED` unset in env + `playOptionChainRequired()` defaults false at `spx-play-config.ts:417`). Two fresh gate fixes shipped **today while market closed** and are unvalidated: `5eee3ff` "unblock play entries — 6-bug gate audit" (12:35 PT) + `cee2ebf` "0DTE calibration" (12:47 PT). Cron path correct (`spx-evaluator.ts:41` → `evaluateSpxPlay({mutate:true})` → `openPlay` → `insertOpenSpxPlay`). **VERIFY Mon 2026-06-29 after RTH:** re-query `spx_open_play` (expect rows) + `cron_job_runs` for `play_action=BUY`. IF still 0 BUY after Monday's full session → escalate to P1 and read the `63567cb` diagnostic logs for the rejecting gate. Do NOT re-touch the veto. _(found 2026-06-27 07:10; refined 12:13 + 16:10)_
- [ ] **P2-A ✅ annotated-resolved** `/api/market/anomalies` and `/api/market/regime` serve 200 unauthenticated while sibling routes 401. **20:15:** both routes now carry explicit "intentionally public — market-wide, no paid data" annotations (`anomalies/route.ts:1-4`, `regime/route.ts:1-3`) — the documented-public fix prior runs proposed. No paid-data leak (both empty). Substance now folds into **P1-A** (empty because nothing writes them). Keeping pointer; auth-boundary addressed by annotation. _(found 07:10; annotation confirmed 20:15)_
- [ ] **P2-B** `spx_signal_log` is now **fully empty (0 rows, max null)** in prod — re-verified live 20:15 (prior runs saw "last wrote 06-17"; table now empty). No writer anywhere. If any admin/analytics surface reads it, it serves nothing. Confirm superseded by the play engine; retire table + readers or resume writes. _(found 07:10; re-verified empty 20:15)_

## 🔵 P3 — open (tech debt / tooling)
- [ ] **P3-1** deep-platform-audit `SKILL.md` produces false P0/P1 every run: stale probe paths (`/api/market/spx-pulse`→`/api/market/spx/pulse`, `/api/flows`→`/api/market/flows`, `/api/nighthawk/latest-edition`→`/api/market/nighthawk/edition`, `/api/grid/news`→none), wrong env-var names (`UNUSUAL_WHALES_API_KEY`→`UW_API_KEY`), and a db-handler regex (`pool\.on`) that misses the real `livePool.on("error")` (`db.ts:113`). Fix the SKILL's probe lists. _(found 2026-06-27 00:12, reconfirmed 07:10)_
- [ ] **P3-2** `spx_pulse_snapshots` and `spx_watch_setups` exist in prod with 0 rows all-time and **zero INSERT code references** in `src/` → dead/legacy tables. Drop them or wire the intended writers. _(found 2026-06-27 07:10)_
- [ ] **P3-3 (NEW 20:15)** Fail-open cron-write guard. `market/anomalies/route.ts:38` and `market/regime/route.ts` POST handlers use `if (cronSecret && auth !== ` + "`Bearer ${cronSecret}`" + `)` — when `CRON_SECRET` is unset the guard short-circuits and the POST is accepted unauthenticated. `CRON_SECRET` is set in prod (no live exposure); defense-in-depth only. Prefer failing closed: `if (!cronSecret || auth !== …)`. **3rd instance found 2026-06-28 00:14:** `track-record/publish/route.ts:9` uses the identical fail-open pattern. _(found 2026-06-27 20:15; +instance 2026-06-28)_

## ✅ Recently confirmed FIXED
- **VAPID push (was inert)** — RESOLVED 16:10: `NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` + `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` + `VAPID_SUBJECT` all set in prod env → push alerts no longer inert

- **P2-2 / #97 (was open 00:12)** `SpxDarkPoolCard` — RESOLVED: now imported + mounted at `SpxDashboard.tsx:13,86` (verified 07:10)
- **#100** pg Pool idle-error handler — `db.ts:113`
- **#101** Clerk `user.created` webhook — `webhook/clerk/route.ts:77`
- **#102** Polygon WS leader election — `ws/polygon-socket.ts:117-148`
