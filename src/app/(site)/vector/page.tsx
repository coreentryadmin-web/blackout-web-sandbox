  // Observed rail ONLY — exactly what the live recorder captured point-in-time during RTH:
  // genuinely dynamic walls that shift/build/fade with the tape (in-memory + persisted Redis/PG
  // rows). `sessionYmd` comes from fetchVectorSeedBars, which walks back to the most recent day
  // that actually HAS price bars — so off-hours (weekend/overnight) this is the last RTH session,
  // and loadSessionWallHistory(sessionYmd) returns THAT session's real recorded beads. The bars
  // and the rail therefore always describe the same session and align on the time axis.
  //
  // The modeled full-width underlay (reconstructSessionRail + mergeModeledUnderlay) was REMOVED
  // here (2026-07-12, user-directed). Because intraday OI history is unpublished, the
  // reconstruction can only replay the CLOSING chain back-projected across every bucket — a flat,
  // uniform full-width rail that reads as fake "static open→close lines" and is the opposite of
  // the point-in-time dynamism a bead rail implies. A member could not tell a wall that held all
  // day from one that formed at noon. Showing only observed samples means every bead the member
  // sees is a real point-in-time observation; where nothing was recorded we show an honest gap (or
  // the single as-of-close seed below), never a model smeared across the session. The
  // reconstruction module lives on for the strike×time heatmap (#14), where a back-projected grid
  // is openly a MODEL — the honest primitive for that surface, unlike an observed bead.
